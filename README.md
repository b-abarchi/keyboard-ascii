# keyboard-ascii
GENERA INFORMATION:

   You have been hired by a company that makes keyboards.  The company is doing a test to see which keys on the keyboard are used the most and the least.  The assumption is the keys used the most will have to have better hardware and the keys used the least can have cheaper hardware.  In order to be competitive in the marketplace, it is important to obtain data on the use of the keys on the keyboard. 
   
  The program will have the following menu:
  1.	Press a Key(s) on Keyboard
  2.	Display how many of each key that has been pressed (in order from high to low)
  3.	Display the key that have never been pressed
  4.	Display the key that has been pressed the most
  5.	Quit
  
 FEATURES:
  1.	Design tool 
  2.	Program look and feel and layout
  3.	Use of Functions (program should be written using individual functions)
  4.	Use of Arrays
  5.	Passing the array to a function to store characters from the keyboard
  6.	Sorting the Array Function
  7.	Searching the Array Function
  8.	Error checking (do not allow users to do dumb things)
  9.	The Menu System
  10.	Comments and documentation within code

  Notes
  
  You will need an array or arrays to store each possible character on your standard keyboard.  You need to keep trace of which character was selected and which characters were not selected.  You may find it necessary to have more than one array.  Hint: parallel arrays.
